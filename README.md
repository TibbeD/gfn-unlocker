## Known issues
#### Cursor doesn't always work well (Firefox)
That is not an issue with this extension, it is an issue with Geforcenow and Firefox. The only thing what this extension does is forcing geforce now to act like everything is offically supported (or something like that, I didn't look at the Javascript when I forked this, I only changed the UI) the cursor not working well always is probably the reason that geforce now doesn't officially support Firefox, and they don't fix that bug and instead just redirect Firefox users to the not supported page is probably that relatively few people use Firefox, and they feel like Firefox users can also just download the windows or macOS app. Unfortunately nvidia almost never has their stuff also for opensource things. ):

#### things you should know
  - MIT doesn't apply to the icon, I think you can probably use it though, I didn't trademark it and images of simple geometry are in most jurisdictions not eligible for copyright. I think the US is included in the country's where the icon is below the minimum threshold of originality for copyright protection. So it's probably not mandatory, but I would still like it if people who want to use it would ask for permission first.
