The original was [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), I don't know yet what license I want to give this fork (the mit license allows sublicensing), it is probably going to be [GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license) or this fork is also going to be MIT. If you want to fork this fork, or if you want to use parts that I edited in any other way before I decided about the license, please tell me, so I  know I have to hurry with deciding what it is going to be :)
