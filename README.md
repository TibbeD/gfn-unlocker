## Known issues
#### Cursor doesn't always work well (Firefox)
That is not an issue with this extension, it is an issue with Geforcenow and Firefox. The only thing what this extension does is forcing geforce now to act like everything is offically supported (or something like that, I didn't look at the Javascript when I forked this, I only changed the UI) the cursor not working well always is probably the reason that geforce now doesn't officially support Firefox, and they don't fix that bug and instead just redirect Firefox users to the not supported page is probably that relatively few people use Firefox, and they feel like Firefox users can also just download the windows or macOS app. Unfortunately nvidia almost never has their stuff also for linux ):

#### copyright that I have: 
the copyright I have on my edits of the code is [GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license). The GPL license doesn't apply to any media (at this moment only the icon) in this repository!
#### things you should know
  - GPL is less permissive than MIT in all areas, so you only need to pay attention to the GPL license. Unlike MIT, GPL requires derivative works to have the same license. So    pay attention to that.
  - GPL doesn't apply to the icon, I think you can probably use it though, I didn't trademark it and images of simple geometry are in many jurisdictions not eligible for copyright. I think the US is included in the country's where the icon is below the minimum threshold of originality for copyright protection. So it's probably not mandatory, but I would still like it if people who want to use it would ask for permission first.

when you only use parts of this repo that I didn't change MIT is the only license that applies ofcourse!

#### questions on license/copyright
##### 2 licenses? Does that mean I can choose?
no, I forked [murar8/gfn-unlocker](https://github.com/murar8/gfn-unlocker) which is MIT, and everything I edited (which is not much yet) in this repo, except for the icon, is GPL. 
##### Is it legal to fork a MIT licensed project and license it GPL?
Yes, the MIT license allows modifying and sublicensing, but "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software." I think I have fulfilled that by also mentioning above that I am not the sole copyright holder and the original was MIT and mentioning the MIT license where I mention the copyright of Lorenzo Murarotto. I didn't study law, and I didn't 100% understand the license, so if you think I didn't fulfill that requirement, please contact me.
