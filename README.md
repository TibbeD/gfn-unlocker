## Known issues
#### Cursor doesn't work well (Firefox)
That is not an issue with this extension, it is an issue with Geforcenow and Firefox. The only thing what this extension does is forcing geforce now to act like everything is offically supported (or something like that, I didn't look at the Javascript when I forked this, I only changed the UI) the cursor not working well always is probably the reason that geforce now doesn't officially support Firefox, and they don't fix it because most people use a chromium based browser, and the bug isn't there in chromium based browsers.

#### questions on license/copyright
##### 2 licenses? Does that mean I can choose?
no, I forked [murar8/gfn-unlocker](https://github.com/murar8/gfn-unlocker) which is MIT, and everything I edited (which is not much yet) in this repo, except for the icon, is GPL. 
##### Is it legal to fork a MIT licensed project and license it GPL?
Yes, the MIT license allows modifying and sublicensing, but "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software." I think I have fulfilled that by also mentioning above that I am not the sole copyright holder and the original was MIT and mentioning the MIT license where I mention the copyright of Lorenzo Murarotto. I didn't study law, and I didn't 100% understand the license, so if you think I didn't fulfill that requirement, please contact me.
