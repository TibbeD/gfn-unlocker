## Known issues
#### Cursor doesn't work well (Firefox)
That is not an issue with this extension, it is an issue with Geforcenow and Firefox. The only thing what this extension does is forcing geforce now to act like Firefox is offically supported (or something like that, I didn't look at the Javascript when I forked this, I only changed the UI) the cursor not working well always is probably the reason that geforce now doesn't officially support Firefox, and they don't fix it because most people use a chromium based browser, and the bug isn't there in chromium based browsers.

The original was licensed with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), I don't know yet what license I want to give this fork (the mit license allows sublicensing), it is probably going to be [GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license) or this fork is also going to be MIT. If you want to fork this fork, or if you want to use parts that I edited in any other way before I decided about the license, please tell me, so I  know I have to hurry with deciding what it is going to be :)
